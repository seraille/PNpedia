## Notations

We use the following notations:
* ``G`` is Newton's constant of gravitation
* ``c`` is the speed of light
* ``\[Delta][i,j]`` is the flat metric defined on the 3 dimensional euclidian space
* ``m1`` and ``m2`` are the masses of body 1 and body 2
* ``m`` is the total mass of the binary $m=m_{1}+m_{2}$
* ``\[Nu]`` is the symmetric mass ratio  $\nu = m_1 m_2 / m^2$
* ``\[CapitalDelta]`` is the relative mass difference $\Delta= (m_1-m_2)/m$ 
* ``y1[i]`` and ``y2[i]`` are the positions of body 1 and body 2
* ``r`` is the distance between the two bodies
* ``n[i]`` is the unit separation vector  between the two bodies $n^i = (y_1^i-y_2^i)/r$
* ``v1[i]`` and ``v2[i]`` are the velocities of body 1 and body 2
* ``v[i]`` is the relative velocity $v^i = v_1^i - v_2^i$
* ``v`` is the norm of the relative Velocity
* ``b0`` is en arbitrary scale used for the tail contribution
* ``\[CapitalPi][i]`` is the integral of the impulsion flux  $\Pi^i = \int_{-\infty}^{t}  dt'  F_{P}^i(t')$ 
* Scalar products are denoted ``U[i]V[-i] = UV`` :  nv, \[CapitalPi]v, \[CapitalPi]n


We have also introduced the functions defining the hereditary contributions :
* $I_{\text{CM},\text{4PN}}$, such that the 4PN contribution to the relative acceleration in the center of mass frame reads $a^i_{\text{CM}~\text{4PN}}=-\frac{4 G m}{5 c^8} y_1^j \int_0^{+\infty} d\tau ~ \ln\left(\frac{c \tau}{2 b0}\right) \Big[I_{\text{CM}~\text{4PN}}\[i,j\](t-\tau)+I_{\text{CM}~\text{4PN}}\[i,j\](t+\tau)\Big]$, where $I_{\text{CM}~\text{4PN}}[i,j]=\frac{d^7}{dt^7}\big(m \nu (x^i x^j -\frac{1}{3} \delta^{ij}x^2)\big)$ is the time derivative of the quadrupole at Newtonian order in the center of mass frame with $\delta^{ij}$ being the Kronecker delta.
